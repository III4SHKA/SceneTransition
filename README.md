# Unity Loading Screen Animation

This project provides a simple and effective loading screen system for Unity.

It includes:

- **Animated PNG file** — used as the visual for the loading animation.
- **C# Script** — manages scene transitions and activates the loading animation while the next scene loads.

## Features

- Seamless integration with Unity projects
- Scene switching with animated feedback
- Customizable and lightweight

## How to Use

1. Add the PNG animation to your Unity project's UI (e.g., using `Image` in a `Canvas`).
2. Attach the provided script to a GameObject in your scene.
3. Configure the target scene name and animation as needed in the script inspector.
