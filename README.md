# SceneTransition

This Unity project provides a simple **pixelated scene transition effect** using a PNG mask and C# script.

## ✨ Features

- Pixelated scene transition (like retro game effects)
- PNG-based mask for controlling transition pattern
- Easy-to-use script component to trigger transitions

## 🖼️ Assets Used

- **PNG Transition Mask**: A pixelated transparent PNG image that defines how the scene is revealed.
- **Transition Script**: Custom Unity C# script to manage scene fade in/out using the mask.

## 📂 How to Use

1. Import the PNG mask into your Unity project.
2. Attach the `SceneTransition` script to a GameObject.
3. Call `StartTransition()` to begin the pixel fade effect.

You can customize the duration, texture, and direction via the script's public fields in the Inspector.
